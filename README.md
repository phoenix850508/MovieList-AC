# MovieList-AC

MovieList-AC is a micro-project that fetches 80 JSON movie data from AC, the main feature is to view more detailed information about movies and 
adding movies to favorite list for the convenience of reviewing their information at a later time. 

I've also included the feature to switch the mode between card and list view, and search bar function that allows users to view the movies which match
the keywords inputed in the search bar.

## Searching
Input keywords in the search bar, and the movie titles that match the input keyword will be shown at the index page.

## Favorite List
Press the "+" botton at the index page, you could check out the Favorite page to view the movies that were added to the favorite list. To remove the moview from the favorite list, you could either click the "+" botton again at tge index page, or press the "X" button at the facorite page.
